1. Add a New Central Dashboard Box
“Tell Us What You Need”

This must appear prominently in the center of the Overview page (above or between Founder Focus Score and Current Stage).

The goal is to make the dashboard feel interactive and human, not static.

Title:

Tell Us What You Need

Subtitle:

What would help you most right now?

Options (multi-select allowed):

Clarifying my idea

Finding my first customers

Structuring my business model

Staying focused and accountable

Getting feedback from a mentor

I feel stuck and need direction

Other (with text field)

Optional Message Field:

“Tell us in a few sentences what you're building or what feels unclear.”

Button:

Send to TouchConnectPro Team

After Submission:

Show confirmation message:
“Thanks. Our team will review this and guide you with next steps.”

Send structured data to Admin (not just a plain chat message).

Tag the user profile internally based on selected options.

Store message history in the user record.

Important:
This should look warm and supportive, not like a support ticket system.
Keep layout and design consistent with the current dashboard style.

2. Replace “Submit Your Business Idea” With a Smart Founder Snapshot (Step 1)

Instead of sending users directly to the 42-question form, create a lightweight intake form with 6 structured questions.

This reduces friction and creates micro-commitment.

Smart Founder Snapshot – Questions

What are you building?
Short paragraph (3–5 sentences).
Ask them to describe the problem they are solving and for whom.

What stage are you at?
Single choice:

Just an idea

MVP or prototype

Website live

Paying clients

Generating recurring revenue

Who is your target customer?
Open text field. Encourage specificity.

What is your current biggest blocker?
Single choice:

Need clarity on positioning

Don’t know how to get customers

Need help structuring my offer

Struggle with focus and execution

Need funding or financial structure

Feel overwhelmed

Other (with text field)

What traction do you currently have?
Single choice:

No validation yet

Early feedback from potential users

Beta users

First paying clients

Growing revenue

What is your main goal for the next 90 days?
Open text field. Encourage concrete goals.

3. After Submission – Auto-Generate a Founder Snapshot Summary

Once Step 1 is submitted:

Unlock dashboard features.

Display a section called “Your Initial Founder Snapshot”.

Automatically summarize:

Stage

Main blocker

Traction level

90-day goal

Generate 2–3 suggested next focus steps based on their answers (rule-based logic is fine for now).

Example format:

Your Initial Founder Snapshot
Stage: Early Validation
Main Challenge: Customer Acquisition
Traction: No validation yet
90-Day Goal: Launch MVP

Suggested Next Focus:

Validate your problem with real conversations.

Narrow down your target niche.

Define a simple offer before building more.

Add a button:
Complete Your Full Founder Blueprint

4. Full 42-Question Blueprint Logic

The 42-question Founder Blueprint must NOT be visible before Smart Founder Snapshot is completed.

After Step 1:

Replace dashboard links (Business Plan, etc.) so they now point to the full 42-question Blueprint.

Make it feel like a natural next step, not an entry requirement.

5. Internal Tagging System

For both:

Tell Us What You Need box

Smart Founder Snapshot

Store structured data and tag users internally based on:

Stage

Biggest blocker

Traction level

Selected needs

90-day goal theme

This will be used for:

Personalized follow-up emails

Mentor matching

Upgrade targeting

Community insights

6. Objective

This redesign must:

Reduce friction for new free members.

Increase early engagement.

Make the platform feel guided and intelligent.

Create contextual upgrade triggers for Founders Circle.

Keep layout, menus, and visual consistency unchanged.

The experience should feel supportive, structured, and human from the first login.
