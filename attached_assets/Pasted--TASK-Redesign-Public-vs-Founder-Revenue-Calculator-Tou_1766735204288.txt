📌 TASK — Redesign Public vs Founder Revenue Calculator (TouchConnectPro)
Objective

Redesign the revenue calculator to be credible, educational, and durable (usable for years), not promotional or hype-driven.

The calculator must have two clearly separated views:

Public View (for visitors)

Founder View (internal, private)

1️⃣ Public View — What to Build
🎯 Purpose

Educate visitors and build trust by explaining how a SaaS + coaching marketplace works, without exposing margins, costs, or sensitive assumptions.

This view should not try to sell profit.

🔹 Public Inputs (Keep Simple)

Monthly website visitors

Conversion rate (%)

Monthly subscription price ($)

Optional toggle: “Include coaching revenue”
→ Uses fixed assumptions (not editable)

🔹 Public Outputs (With Time Context)

❗ All numbers must include time framing (no raw large numbers).

Section A — Month 1 Estimate

Show:

New paying members (Month 1)

Estimated platform revenue (Month 1)

Add small helper text:

Based on new subscribers acquired this month

Section B — Steady-State Monthly Estimate

Show:

Estimated active paying members (steady-state)

Estimated monthly platform revenue

Helper text:

Assumes consistent traffic, conversion, and average retention over time

🔹 Visuals (Optional but Recommended)

One simple line chart:

X-axis: Months

Y-axis: Active subscribers

Label clearly:

Illustrative growth under constant assumptions

No “hockey stick”, no exaggerated scaling.

🔹 Copy Rules (Very Important)

Remove all:

“Profit potential: Strong”

“Positive unit economics”

Any promotional language

Replace with neutral copy:

This estimate illustrates how subscription-based platforms typically scale over time.

🔹 What Must NOT Appear in Public View

❌ Costs
❌ Mentor payouts
❌ Profit margins
❌ Stripe fees
❌ 3-year financial tables
❌ Editable coaching assumptions

2️⃣ Founder View — What to Build
🎯 Purpose

Give the founder full financial visibility for decision-making.

This view can be gated (login, admin, or internal only).

🔹 Founder Inputs (Fully Editable)

Visitor growth

Conversion rate

Subscription price

Coaching adoption rate (default 20%)

Avg coaching spend per buyer ($200)

Platform commission (20%)

Retention / churn

Stripe fees

Tooling costs

🔹 Founder Outputs (Detailed)

Subscription revenue

Coaching commission revenue

Total platform revenue (100%)

Mentor expenses:

50% of subscription revenue

50% of coaching commission revenue

Other operating costs

Net profit

Profit margin (%)

🔹 Time-Based Views (Required)

Provide:

Monthly view

12-month view

36-month view (3 years)

Suggested presentation:

Table (Month × Metrics)

Chart toggle:

Revenue

Costs

Net profit

3️⃣ Accounting Rule (Must Be Respected)

Platform revenue is always shown at 100%.
Mentor payouts are recorded strictly as expenses, never as revenue reduction.

This rule must be applied consistently across all calculations.

4️⃣ UX Guidance

Public view = simple, explanatory, confidence-building

Founder view = analytical, precise, decision-oriented

No duplicated complexity in public view

No marketing language in financial outputs

✅ Success Criteria

The calculator should:

Make smart visitors trust the platform

Help founders understand sustainability

Still make sense 3–5 years from now

Avoid any appearance of exaggerated or misleading financial claims
