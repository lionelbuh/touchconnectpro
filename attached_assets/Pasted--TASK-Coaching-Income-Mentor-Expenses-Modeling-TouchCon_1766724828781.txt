📌 TASK — Coaching Income & Mentor Expenses Modeling (TouchConnectPro)
Context

TouchConnectPro is a SaaS + marketplace platform with:

Subscription revenue

Coaching services commission revenue

Mentor payouts treated as expenses, not revenue reduction

For accounting and modeling purposes:
👉 100% of platform income is TouchConnectPro revenue
👉 Payments to mentors are recorded as expenses (COGS)

1️⃣ Coaching Income (Revenue)

Some subscribers purchase coaching services through the platform.

Assumptions (Editable in Internal Mode)

Coaching adoption rate: 20% of active subscribers

Average coaching spend per buyer: $200 / month

Platform commission: 20%

Logic

TouchConnectPro earns 20% commission on coaching GMV

This commission is 100% platform revenue

The remaining 80% of GMV paid to coaches is not revenue and should not be included in income

Formulas
coachingBuyers =
  activeSubscribers * coachingAdoptionRate

grossCoachingGMV =
  coachingBuyers * avgCoachingSpendPerUser

coachingCommissionRevenue =
  grossCoachingGMV * platformCommissionRate

2️⃣ Mentor Expenses (Cost of Services)

Mentors are compensated based on platform revenue.

Expense Rules

Mentors receive:

50% of subscription revenue

50% of coaching commission revenue

These payouts must be modeled as expenses (COGS).

Formulas
mentorSubscriptionExpense =
  subscriptionRevenue * 0.50

mentorCommissionExpense =
  coachingCommissionRevenue * 0.50

totalMentorExpenses =
  mentorSubscriptionExpense +
  mentorCommissionExpense

3️⃣ Revenue vs Costs (Important Rule)

Do NOT subtract mentor payouts from revenue

Revenue must stay at 100%

Mentor payments appear only in the costs section

4️⃣ Display Requirements

✅ Success Criteria

The calculator must clearly distinguish:

Platform revenue

Mentor expenses

Net profit

And must never:
❌ Mix GMV with revenue
❌ Reduce revenue by mentor payouts

Key Accounting Principle

Revenue = income
Mentor payouts = cost of delivering the service

This distinction is critical and must be respected throughout the calculator logic.
