🌟 Become a Mentor at TouchToolsBusiness

We are building a network of mentors who believe in the power of entrepreneurship — and in the people behind it.
TouchToolsBusiness is designed to guide founders from their first idea to market launch, supported not only by AI but by real humans who’ve been there, built things, solved problems, and pushed through the messy middle.

We are currently seeking mentors who bring experience, wisdom, and a genuine desire to help new entrepreneurs succeed.

👥 Who We're Looking For

We welcome mentors with strong professional backgrounds, ideally including:

✔ Experience in startups, innovation, or fast-growing companies
✔ Understanding of product development, market strategy, and business growth
✔ Knowledge of corporate structures, fundraising, or scaling operations
✔ Strength in guiding others, problem-solving, and strategic thinking
✔ Patience, empathy, and leadership — especially when entrepreneurs face difficult situations

You don’t need to know everything. You need to care, think critically, and share what you’ve learned along the way.

🔥 Mentor Role & Commitment

Each mentor will guide and follow a group of at least 10 entrepreneurs, helping them progress month after month.
This represents approximately 10 hours of participation per month including group sessions, feedback, and follow-up.

Mentors who wish to commit more time may lead additional groups of 10, allowing them to support more founders while increasing their impact within TouchToolsBusiness.

💛 Why Mentor With Us?

At TouchToolsBusiness, mentorship is a relationship — not just a transaction.

Our goal is not only to help build companies, but to support the people behind them. Mentors will accompany entrepreneurs through decisions, strategy, setbacks and breakthroughs, and into market success.

Compensation is provided, but the real motivation is purpose, impact, and community.
We are looking for mentors who value teaching, guiding and elevating others.
