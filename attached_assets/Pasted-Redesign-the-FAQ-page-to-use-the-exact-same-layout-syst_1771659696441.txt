Redesign the FAQ page to use the exact same layout system, color palette, spacing, typography, and human-centered feel as the homepage and pricing page.

Important:
Do NOT change any of the questions or answers. Keep all text exactly as it is. Only update the layout and visual presentation.

Goal:
Make the FAQ page feel warm, premium, and intentional. Avoid generic accordion templates or rigid support-center styling.

Use the same design system:

Background base: Soft cream (#FAF9F7)

Alternating sections: Light gray (#F3F3F3)

Headings: Deep teal (#0D566C)

Body text: Dark gray (#4A4A4A)

Accent highlights: Coral (#FF6B5C)

Subtle highlight elements: Warm yellow (#F5C542)

Soft shadows for cards

Layout instructions:

Page Hero Section
Create a clean hero section consistent with other pages.

Headline:
Frequently Asked Questions

Subtext:
Everything you need to know about TouchConnectPro.

Keep spacing generous. Centered layout. Soft cream background.

Section Structure

Instead of one long flat FAQ list, group questions visually by category:

About TouchConnectPro

Getting Started

Mentors & Approval

Mentor Response Guidelines

Trust & Privacy

Pricing & Billing

Funding & Growth

Each category should:

Have a clear section header in Deep teal

Be separated with comfortable spacing

Alternate soft cream and light gray backgrounds between major sections

FAQ Interaction Style

Use a refined accordion style but avoid generic UI.

Each question inside a soft card with subtle shadow

Rounded corners

Clean expand/collapse animation

Smooth transition when opening

Plus icon or subtle arrow icon in Coral

When expanded, keep text easy to read with comfortable line spacing

Human Feel Improvements

Avoid tight spacing

Avoid small dense text blocks

Keep margins generous

Make the page feel breathable and calm

Slight asymmetry or subtle dividers to avoid a rigid template feel

Visual Consistency

Ensure:

Same button style as homepage

Same typography scale

Same hover effects

Same section rhythm

The FAQ page should feel like part of the same product ecosystem, not a separate help center template.
