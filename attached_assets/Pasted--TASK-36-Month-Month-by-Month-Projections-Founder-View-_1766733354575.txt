📌 TASK — 36-Month Month-by-Month Projections (Founder View Only)
Context & Intent

TouchConnectPro’s revenue calculator must support long-term SaaS planning.

The goal is not forecasting marketing growth, but projecting unit economics over time using constant assumptions.

This feature is:

Required in Founder view

Explicitly excluded from Public view

1️⃣ Scope Rules

Founder mode only

Frontend only

Same calculation logic as Month 1

No backend, no persistence required

Assumptions remain constant unless user changes inputs

2️⃣ Projection Logic (Core Requirement)

The projection runs month by month for 36 months.

Each month:

Start with previous month’s active subscribers

Add new subscribers

Remove churned subscribers

Recalculate all revenue and cost metrics

Subscriber Evolution
newSubscribers =
  monthlyVisitors * conversionRate

churnedSubscribers =
  previousActiveSubscribers * churnRate

activeSubscribers[month] =
  previousActiveSubscribers
  + newSubscribers
  - churnedSubscribers

3️⃣ Monthly Calculations (Per Month)

For each month, compute:

Subscription revenue

Coaching commission revenue

Total revenue

Mentor expenses (50% of revenue components)

Stripe fees

Fixed costs

Variable costs

Marketing costs

Total costs

Net profit

Net margin %

⚠️ Use the same formulas already defined for Month 1.

4️⃣ Presentation Requirements (Founder UX)
A. Month Selector

Slider or dropdown:

Month 1 → Month 36

Selecting a month updates all displayed values

B. Summary Cards (Always Visible)

Active subscribers

Total revenue

Total costs

Net profit

Net margin %

C. Charts (Line Charts)

Include the following charts:

Active subscribers over time

Revenue vs costs over time

Net profit over time

Defaults:

36-month range

Optional toggle: 12 / 24 / 36 months

D. Detailed Table (Optional, Collapsible)
Month	Subscribers	Revenue	Costs	Profit

Collapsed by default

Optional CSV export

5️⃣ Public Mode Constraint (Critical)

Public mode must:

❌ NOT show month-by-month projections

❌ NOT show long-term growth curves

❌ NOT expose margins or cost structure

Public mode may show:

A single monthly snapshot

A simple estimate with disclaimer

6️⃣ Disclaimers (Founder Mode)

Display a small note:

“Projections assume constant traffic, conversion, churn, and pricing. This is a planning tool, not a forecast.”

7️⃣ Success Criteria

The founder must be able to:

Scrub month-by-month

See when the business becomes profitable

Understand how churn impacts long-term sustainability

Use this as an investor-grade planning tool

🧠 Design Principle (Do Not Break)

One calculator

One logic

Two views (Founder / Public)

Time projection only in Founder view
