Redesign the Pricing page of TouchConnectPro to match the same human-centered tone, colors, and visual style as the homepage.

Goal:
Make the page feel supportive, premium, and clear. Avoid corporate or mechanical language. Keep the structure simple, warm, and easy to scan. The progression between plans should feel natural and aspirational.

Use the same color system as the homepage:

Backgrounds: Soft cream (#FAF9F7) and light gray (#F3F3F3)

Primary headings: Deep teal (#0D566C)

Accent buttons and highlights: Coral (#FF6B5C)

Highlight elements: Warm yellow (#F5C542)

Body text: Dark gray (#4A4A4A)

Premium section option: Deep teal background with white text

Layout guidance:

Three clear pricing cards displayed side by side on desktop

Slightly highlight the middle plan as “Most Popular”

Add generous spacing and soft shadows

Use subtle hover effects on buttons

Keep typography consistent with homepage

Avoid rigid or generic SaaS template styling

Tone guidance:

Warm, clear, and supportive

Short sentences

No overly corporate phrases

Emphasize progression, not transactions
