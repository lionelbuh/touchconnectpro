Overview

We want to build a free tool called Founder Focus Score and connect it to a controlled dashboard access flow that converts qualified founders into paid members.

The idea is:

Founder completes a 5 minute diagnostic tool

Founder gets immediate value and clarity

Founder receives limited dashboard access for 7 days

Founder must apply and become a paid member to continue

Part 1: Founder Focus Score Tool
Purpose

The Founder Focus Score is a short diagnostic tool that identifies a founder’s single biggest growth blocker and tells them what to fix next.

It must feel:

Fast

Useful

Personalized

No signup required to see results

Tool Flow

Public landing page
Short explanation of the tool and a start button.

Questionnaire

8 questions

Each question has 4 answers

Each answer maps to one of 4 categories:

Strategy

Sales

Operations

Execution

Scoring

Each selected answer adds +10 points to its category

The category with the highest total is the founder’s primary blocker

Results page
Immediately show:

Founder Focus Score (0 to 100)

Primary blocker category

Short explanation of what this means

One concrete action they should take next

No email or account is required up to this point.

Part 2: Dashboard Trial Access
Entry Point

On the results page, show a CTA:

“Unlock the Entrepreneur Dashboard for 7 days”

Only at this point:

Ask for email

Create a user account

Trial Account Setup

When a user activates the trial:

Status = Trial Entrepreneur

Trial length = 7 days from activation

No payment required

Trial Permissions

During the 7 day trial, the user can access:

Dashboard Section: Clarity and Focus

Their Founder Focus Score recap

Weekly priority definition tools

Focus and decision exercises

All other dashboard sections:

Visible but locked

Clearly labeled as available after membership

Mentor Messaging

Admin manually assigns a mentor to the trial user

Once assigned, the user can:

Message the mentor inside the platform

Messaging rules:

Text only

One to one

No file uploads

This creates value without giving full coaching access.

Part 3: Trial Expiration Logic
During Trial

Show countdown banner: “Trial ends in X days”

Automated reminders:

Day 5: Trial ending soon

Day 7: Trial ending today

After Trial Ends

When the 7 days are over:

Dashboard becomes read only

Mentor messaging is disabled

User status changes to Trial Expired

Part 4: Entrepreneur Application Flow

After trial expiration:

User gains access to the Entrepreneur Application Form

Same application used by regular entrepreneurs

Submission:

Status becomes Application Submitted

Admin reviews manually

Part 5: Approval and Paid Membership

If admin approves the application:

User status = Approved Awaiting Payment

User is prompted to:

Choose a membership plan

Complete payment

After payment:

Status becomes Active Entrepreneur

Full dashboard access unlocked

Full mentor interaction enabled

Status and Permission Summary

Statuses to implement:

Trial Entrepreneur

Active Entrepreneur

Each status controls:

Dashboard access

Key Principles
