Project Overview

I want to build a secure, password-protected online financial model dashboard for my business.

This is not just a spreadsheet viewer. It should be:

Web-based

Login protected (single password or user authentication)

Structured into multiple screens

Editable for assumptions

Automatically calculating Revenue, P&L, Cash Flow, and Annual Summary

Able to switch between years (2026, 2027, 2028)

The model is based on bookings, installations, churn, and portal growth, not just flat revenue inputs.

1️⃣ LOGIN & SECURITY

Password-protected access

Hosted securely (SSL)

Ideally ability to later add role-based access (Admin / View Only)

2️⃣ SCREEN 1: ASSUMPTIONS PAGE

This page must be fully editable.
All fields below should be input fields (not hardcoded numbers).

GENERAL

Model basis (Bookings)

Currency

Model start month

Monthly churn rate

Upfront % (hardware)

On delivery % (hardware)

NORO PORTALS

Annual software / portal

HW margin per portal (cash)

SHARED STUDIOS

Average monthly bookings

COGS %

Install lag (months)

CUSTOMER TYPES TABLE

Columns:

Start

Enterprise

Global

Rows:

Portals per Customer

Organizers per customer

Pricing

Charged annually

PEOPLE

Benefits %

Founders paid as contractors until threshold amount

OPERATING EXPENSES (Editable by Year)

For each year (2026–2028):

Marketing – monthly

G&A – monthly

R&D – monthly

FINANCING & CASH

Starting cash

Known fundraise inflows (by year)

Loan repayments – monthly

GROWTH ASSUMPTIONS (2027–2028)

For each year:

New Portals

Q1 %

Q2 %

Q3 %

Q4 %

These percentages distribute new portals across quarters.

3️⃣ SCREEN 2: REVENUE MODEL (Monthly View – 2026, 2027, 2028 toggle)

The system should calculate automatically:

Customer Metrics (Monthly)

New Entry Customers (signed)

New Enterprise Customers (signed)

New Global Customers (signed)

Customers Installed (by type)

Active Customers (after churn)

Derived Metrics

Active Portals

Portals Installed (monthly)

Revenue Calculations

Software Revenue (annual reference only)

Usage Revenue (annual reference only)

Hardware Cash In (Revenue)

Important:

Hardware revenue must reflect:

Upfront %

On delivery %

Install lag must delay installation

Churn must reduce active customers monthly

4️⃣ SCREEN 3: P&L (Multi-Year Toggle 2026–2028)

The system should allow switching year.

5️⃣ SCREEN 4: CASH SUMMARY (Multi-Year Toggle)

For each year:

Cash must roll forward automatically:
Ending Cash (Year 1) → Beginning Cash (Year 2)

6️⃣ SCREEN 5: ANNUAL SUMMARY

For each year:

New Noro Revenue

New Shared Studios Revenue

Total Revenue

COGS

Gross Profit

Should display:
2026 | 2027 | 2028 side-by-side

7️⃣ CALCULATION LOGIC REQUIREMENTS

The system must:

Apply churn monthly

Apply install lag

Distribute growth by quarter

Separate hardware vs software vs usage

Distinguish NEW vs recurring revenue

Roll forward cash properly

Allow assumption edits and auto-refresh all outputs

8️⃣ TECHNICAL PREFERENCES (You Can Adjust)

You can tell your developer:

Frontend: React / Next.js

Backend: Node or Python

Database: Store assumptions + saved scenarios

Option to duplicate scenarios later

Export to Excel / PDF

Clean dashboard UI (investor-ready)

9️⃣ How to Explain the Goal Simply

You can summarize to your developer like this:

I want a secure, dynamic financial modeling web app.
It should behave like a structured SaaS financial model, not a spreadsheet.
Assumptions drive everything.
Revenue flows into P&L.
P&L flows into Cash.
Cash rolls forward.
Multi-year toggle.
Investor-ready output.
