We want to upgrade the Founder Focus experience on TouchConnectPro to make it segmented and personalized instead of using the same 8 questions for everyone.

Objective
Create 3 different question tracks based on user profile, and dynamically show the correct set of 8 questions.

Step 1: Add Segmentation Question (Before Quiz Starts)

Add a required first question:

Which best describes you right now?

Options:

I am building my own business

I run a service business (consultant, agency, freelancer, coach)

I am employed but want to start something

I am exploring ideas

Based on the answer, route the user to a specific 8 question track.

Track 1: Founder / Builder (existing)

Keep current 8 questions:

What feels like the biggest obstacle to growing your business right now?

When you think about the next 90 days, what concerns you most?

How would you describe your current product or service offering?

What best describes how you spend most of your time?

If a mentor could help you with one thing, what would it be?

What happens when you try to explain your business to someone new?

How do you feel about your team or resources right now?

What would make you feel like you're finally making real progress?

Track 2: Service Consultants / Agencies

Show these 8 questions if user selects service business:

What feels like the biggest bottleneck in scaling your services right now?

In the next 90 days, what would make the biggest difference to your revenue?

How clear and differentiated is your positioning in the market?

Where does most of your time go today?

How predictable is your lead flow?

What happens when a potential client asks “Why should we choose you?”

How confident do you feel about your pricing?

If you had the right support, what would you want to optimize first? (leads, offer, systems, team, mindset)

Track 3: Employee / Future Founder

Show these 8 questions if user selects employed but want to start:

What is the main reason you want to start something of your own?

What is stopping you from taking the first real step?

Do you already have a clear business idea?

How confident do you feel about turning an idea into income?

How much time per week could you realistically invest?

What scares you most about starting?

Do you feel you have people around you who understand your ambition?

What would need to happen for you to finally say “I am doing this”?

Logic Requirements

The segmentation answer must be stored in the database.

The selected track must also be stored.

We need the ability to:

Show different result pages depending on track

Tag users internally (Founder, Consultant, Future Founder)

Route them later to different mentor types or offers

Keep the UI identical across tracks so the experience feels consistent.
