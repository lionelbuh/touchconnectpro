Redesign the “Founder Focus Score” page and the Diagnostic Questions flow using the exact same layout style, color palette, typography, spacing, and human-centered tone as the homepage and pricing page.

Goal:
Create full visual consistency across the platform. The Focus Score page and question flow should feel like a natural extension of the brand. Warm, clean, modern, and human. Avoid generic SaaS or survey-template styling.

Use the same design system:

Backgrounds: Soft cream (#FAF9F7) and light gray (#F3F3F3)

Headings: Deep teal (#0D566C)

Body text: Dark gray (#4A4A4A)

Primary buttons: Coral (#FF6B5C) with white text

Accent highlights: Warm yellow (#F5C542)

Premium sections if needed: Deep teal background with white text

Layout requirements:

Keep generous spacing and soft shadows

Slight asymmetry where appropriate

Subtle hover effects on buttons

Clean, readable typography

Avoid rigid multi-step form templates

Make the diagnostic feel guided, not clinical

Tone:

Supportive

Clear

Encouraging

Short sentences

No corporate or technical language

Use the following refined copy:

Diagnostic Flow Design Instructions

When the user clicks “Start the diagnostic”:

Use a clean step-by-step interface consistent with the homepage style

Display one question per screen for focus

Include a simple progress indicator at the top

Use soft transitions between questions

Keep buttons large and clear

Avoid survey-style radio buttons that look generic

Make the experience feel guided and intentional

At the end:

Results page should:

Highlight the primary blocker clearly

Provide a short explanation in human language

Display one concrete action step prominently

Include a CTA such as “Refine your idea” or “Join the Community”

The full experience should feel like a guided clarity session, not a typical online quiz.
