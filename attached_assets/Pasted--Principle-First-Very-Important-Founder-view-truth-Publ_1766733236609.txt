🎭 Principle First (Very Important)

Founder view = truth

Public view = education + motivation (not promises)

Public users should understand the model, not see your internal margins.

🌍 PUBLIC VIEW (Marketing / Lead-Gen)
🎯 Goal

Help visitors understand the business potential

Build trust and credibility

Encourage sign-up or contact

Avoid exposing sensitive unit economics

✅ Inputs (Editable)

Only inputs a user can easily relate to:

Monthly website visitors

Conversion rate (%)

Subscription price ($/month)

(Optional, advanced toggle: “Include coaching revenue estimate”)

🔒 Hidden / Fixed (Not Editable)

Use reasonable defaults internally:

Churn rate

Coaching adoption rate (e.g. 20%)

Average coaching spend ($200)

Platform commission (20%)

Mentor revenue share (50%)

Stripe fees

Infrastructure costs

👉 These are your business know-how.

📊 Outputs (Visible)

Keep outputs high-level:

Estimated active members

Estimated monthly platform revenue

Estimated monthly profit range (optional)

Simple visual (Revenue vs Costs)

Avoid:
❌ Exact margins
❌ Cost breakdowns
❌ Mentor payouts

📣 Copy & CTA

Label clearly:

“Estimates only — real results depend on execution.”

CTA:

“Build this business with TouchConnectPro”
or
“See how TouchConnectPro helps you reach these numbers”

🧠 Why This Works

Educates without committing

Avoids legal / trust issues

Positions you as thoughtful, not hype-driven

🛠 Implementation Tip (Tell Your AI Developer)

Build one calculator with a mode flag:
public or founder

The mode only controls visibility and editability, not calculation logic.

🧠 Founder Advice (Very Honest)

If someone asks:

“Why don’t you show full margins publicly?”

The correct answer is:

“Because we want people to understand the opportunity, not reverse-engineer our business.”

That’s normal. That’s smart.
