Redesign the Login page using the exact same layout system, color palette, typography, spacing, and human-centered style as the homepage, pricing page, FAQ page, and Startup Radar page.

Important:
Do NOT change the text content. Keep all wording exactly as written. Only improve the layout and visual presentation.

Goal:
Make the login page feel warm, premium, and consistent with the platform. Avoid default authentication template styling.

Use the same design system:

Background base: Soft cream (#FAF9F7)

Section contrast if needed: Light gray (#F3F3F3)

Headings: Deep teal (#0D566C)

Body text: Dark gray (#4A4A4A)

Primary button: Coral (#FF6B5C) with white text

Accent highlights: Warm yellow (#F5C542)

Soft shadows for form card (#E0E0E0)

Same typography scale as homepage

Layout instructions:

Page Structure

Center the login form vertically and horizontally on the page.

Use a clean, minimal layout with generous spacing. The page should feel calm and focused.

Optional:
Use a split layout on desktop:

Left side: Soft brand statement or subtle background block in Deep teal

Right side: Login form card

On mobile:

Single centered card layout.

Login Form Card

Design the form inside a soft card:

Rounded corners

Subtle shadow

Clean padding

Not full-width

Keep the following text exactly:

Welcome Back
Sign in to your TouchConnectPro account

Email Address
Password
Forgot password?

Add:

Clean input fields with soft borders

Subtle focus state in Coral

Smooth hover on buttons

Button Styling

Primary login button:

Coral background (#FF6B5C)

White text

Slight hover darkening

Full-width button inside form

Human Feel Improvements

Avoid tight spacing

Avoid thin, default system form styling

Use comfortable line height

Keep it visually consistent with homepage CTA sections

Make the experience feel intentional, not like a generic auth page

Optional Subtle Enhancement

Below the form, you may add a soft line such as:

New here? Join the Community for free.

Styled subtly, not overpowering the main login action.

The login page should feel like a natural part of the TouchConnectPro ecosystem, not a separate system screen. Clean, confident, human, and premium.
