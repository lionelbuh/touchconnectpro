Feature: External Reputation Display for Coaches (Admin-Verified)
Goal

Allow coaches to display external reputation only after manual verification by TouchConnectPro admins, without exposing external links to entrepreneurs.

1️⃣ Coach Registration / Onboarding
Section: “External Reputation / Ratings”

Required fields (NOT optional):

Platform name (e.g. MentorCruise)

Average rating (e.g. 4.9)

Number of reviews (e.g. 37)

External profile link

Required for verification

Never visible to entrepreneurs

Helper text (important copy):

“External profile links are required so TouchConnectPro can verify your ratings. These links will never be shown publicly.”

2️⃣ Admin Panel (CRITICAL)
New Admin Controls

For each coach and each external platform:

View:

Platform name

Review count

External profile link

Manual checkbox / toggle:

⬜ Externally verified by TouchConnectPro

Optional:

Rules:

The “Externally verified by TouchConnectPro” badge does NOT appear

3️⃣ Public Coach Profile (Entrepreneurs View)
