We want to build a long-lasting SaaS revenue & business model calculator for TouchConnectPro.

This is not a one-off feature.
It is intended to be:

A founder decision tool

A trusted unit-economics reference

Later, a public marketing & lead-gen asset

Because of this, the calculator must be:

Accurate

Maintainable

Based on first-principle SaaS economics

Built once, reused for years

🧠 Core Product Decision (Important)

👉 Do NOT build two separate calculators.

Instead:

Build one calculator

With two modes:

internal (founder / private)

public (marketing / simplified)

Both modes must:

Use the exact same calculation logic

Differ only in:

Which inputs are visible

Which values are editable vs fixed

Copy/labels and CTA

This avoids:

Double maintenance

Conflicting numbers

Technical debt

🏗 Architecture Overview
Frontend Only

No backend

No authentication

No persistence required (optional LocalStorage)

Recommended Stack

React + TypeScript (or Next.js page)

Tailwind CSS

Optional: Recharts / Chart.js

🧩 Component Structure (Suggested)
RevenueCalculator
├── InputsPanel
│   ├── TrafficInputs
│   ├── PricingInputs
│   ├── CostInputs
│   └── Mode-based visibility
├── Calculations (pure functions)
├── SummaryCards
│   ├── Active Members
│   ├── MRR
│   ├── Total Costs
│   ├── Net Profit
│   └── Margin %
└── OptionalChart


All calculations must live in pure functions (no UI coupling).

🔁 Modes Definition
1️⃣ Internal Mode (mode="internal")

Audience: Founder / Admin
Purpose: Financial modeling, pricing decisions, investors

Editable Inputs

Monthly website visitors

Conversion rate (%)

Subscription price ($/month)

Monthly churn rate (%)

Stripe % fee

Stripe fixed fee per transaction

Fixed monthly costs (infra, tools, email, etc.)

Variable cost per active user (AI, support, scaling)

Monthly marketing spend

Visible Outputs

New members per month

Average customer lifetime (months)

Active paying members

MRR

Stripe fees

Total monthly costs (full breakdown)

Net profit

Net margin %

2️⃣ Public Mode (mode="public")

Audience: Prospects / visitors
Purpose: Education, trust, lead generation

Editable Inputs

Monthly visitors

Conversion rate

Subscription price

Fixed / Hidden Values

Churn rate → fixed realistic default

Stripe fees → assumed

Costs → grouped into “Platform costs”

No detailed cost breakdown shown

Visible Outputs

Estimated monthly revenue

Estimated profit (or profit range)

Active members (optional)

CTA button:

“Build this with TouchConnectPro”

⚠️ Public mode should never look like a promise, only an estimate.

🧮 Required Calculations (Single Source of Truth)
newMembers = visitors * conversionRate

avgLifetimeMonths = 1 / churnRate

activeMembers = newMembers * avgLifetimeMonths

MRR = activeMembers * subscriptionPrice

stripeFees =
  (MRR * stripePercentage) +
  (activeMembers * stripeFixedFee)

variableCosts = activeMembers * variableCostPerUser

totalCosts =
  stripeFees +
  fixedMonthlyCosts +
  variableCosts +
  marketingSpend

netProfit = MRR - totalCosts

netMargin = netProfit / MRR


These formulas must be:

Commented

Reused in both modes

Never duplicated

🎨 UX Expectations

Clean SaaS UI

Sliders + numeric inputs

Instant recalculation (no button needed)

Summary cards clearly highlighting:

MRR

Costs

Profit

Margin

Optional:

Simple MRR vs Costs chart

🧭 Long-Term Thinking (Why This Matters)

This calculator should:

Still make sense in 3–5 years

Survive pricing changes

Survive feature changes

Be trusted as a reference

So:

Avoid hardcoding product-specific assumptions

Keep inputs generic

Separate logic from presentation

✅ Success Criteria

A founder should be able to answer in 30 seconds:

“If I get X visitors, convert at X%, charge X$/month — is this business profitable?”

And later, a visitor should think:

“This platform understands real business economics.”
