Instruction for AI Tool

Redesign the “How It Works” page using the same color palette, typography, spacing, and human-centered tone as the homepage. Keep the experience warm, clear, and approachable. Avoid corporate or accelerator-style language. Make it feel supportive and personal.

Use the same colors:

Backgrounds: Soft cream (#FAF9F7) and light gray (#F3F3F3)

Primary headings: Deep teal (#0D566C)

Accent elements and buttons: Coral (#FF6B5C)

Highlights: Warm yellow (#F5C542)

Text: Dark gray (#4A4A4A)

Keep layout slightly dynamic, not rigid or template-like. Add generous spacing between phases.

Now here is a rewritten version of your content with the same human touch:
