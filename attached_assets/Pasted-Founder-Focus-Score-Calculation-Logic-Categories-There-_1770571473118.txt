Founder Focus Score Calculation Logic
Categories

There are 4 categories:

Strategy

Sales

Operations

Execution

Each question answer contributes to one category only.

Points Assignment

Total questions: 8

Each answer = +10 points to its mapped category

Maximum points per category = 80

Minimum points per category = 0

Step by Step Calculation
Step 1: Initialize category scores

Set all category scores to 0.

strategy = 0
sales = 0
operations = 0
execution = 0

Step 2: Add points per answer

For each answered question:

Identify the category mapped to the selected answer

Add +10 points to that category

Example:

if answer.category == "strategy":
    strategy += 10


Repeat for all questions.

Step 3: Identify the primary blocker

Find the category with the highest score.

maxCategoryScore = max(strategy, sales, operations, execution)


That category is the primary growth blocker.

If there is a tie:

Select the category that appears earliest in the question order
This ensures deterministic behavior.

Step 4: Convert to Founder Focus Score (0 to 100)

The Founder Focus Score represents how focused and balanced the founder is.

Formula
FounderFocusScore = round(
  100 - ((maxCategoryScore / 80) * 40)
)

Why this formula

maxCategoryScore / 80 normalizes the strongest blocker (0 to 1)

Multiply by 40 limits the penalty range

Subtracting from 100 creates a positive score

This produces:

100 when no strong blocker exists

60 when one category dominates strongly

Lower scores when focus is heavily unbalanced

Example Calculations
Example 1: Moderate imbalance
Strategy = 40
Sales = 20
Operations = 10
Execution = 10

maxCategoryScore = 40

FounderFocusScore = 100 - ((40 / 80) * 40)
FounderFocusScore = 100 - 20
FounderFocusScore = 80

Example 2: Strong blocker
Strategy = 60
Sales = 10
Operations = 10
Execution = 0

FounderFocusScore = 100 - ((60 / 80) * 40)
FounderFocusScore = 100 - 30
FounderFocusScore = 70

Example 3: Severe focus issue
Execution = 80
Others = 0

FounderFocusScore = 100 - ((80 / 80) * 40)
FounderFocusScore = 60

Interpretation Ranges

80 to 100 → Strong foundation

60 to 79 → Solid but blocked

40 to 59 → High friction

Below 40 → Not expected with current setup

Output Requirements

On the results page, display:

Founder Focus Score (integer, no decimals)

Primary blocker category

Short explanation text tied to the blocker

Key Notes for Implementation

Keep scoring logic isolated for easy tuning

Question count and weights may change later

Ensure consistent results for repeated inputs
