TouchConnectPro

**Last Updated: [Add Date]

Welcome to TouchConnectPro.com. By using our website, creating an account, booking a coach, or purchasing a membership, you agree to the Terms & Conditions outlined below. If you do not agree, please discontinue use of the platform.

1. Overview of the Platform

TouchConnectPro connects entrepreneurs with mentors, coaches, experts, and resources to grow their business. We provide:

AI-assisted pitch & business material creation

Mentor portfolio placement (upon approval)

Paid 1:1 and group coaching access

Investor presentation preparation

Platform for growth, strategy, and learning

We guide entrepreneurs — but we do not guarantee business results, coaching outcomes, or investor funding decisions.

2. Membership & Subscription

Membership begins only after your project is accepted by a mentor.

Once active, membership is billed monthly through Stripe until canceled.

You may cancel at any time from your dashboard.

Membership pricing may change with notice before renewal.

Coaching sessions purchased separately are not included in your membership fee.

3. Mentor Availability & Changes

Mentorship continuity is supported, however changes may occur if:

Your needs evolve

A mentor becomes unavailable

A new professional becomes a better fit

If a change is required, TouchConnectPro will help transition you to a new suitable mentor.

4. Refund & Cancellation Policy
Membership Cancellation

You may cancel your membership anytime through your dashboard.
Cancellation stops future billing, and your access remains active until the end of the billing cycle.

Membership Refunds

We offer a 7-day refund window for new members.
If you cancel within 7 days of your first charge, you may request a full refund.

After 7 days, membership fees become non-refundable.
No refunds are issued for partial months, unused time, or missed platform use.

Coaching Session Fees

Coaching or consulting sessions are third-party services offered by mentors and are not included in the membership price.

Coaches are responsible for approving or denying refund requests.

TouchConnectPro retains a non-refundable 20% platform commission for providing access to a network of coaches.

No reimbursement of the TouchConnectPro service fee is issued under any circumstance.

5. Data Protection & Privacy

Your privacy matters to us.

By using the platform, you also agree to our Privacy Policy, which explains how we collect, use, and protect your data. Information such as name, email address, usage data, and cookies may be collected to operate the platform, improve user experience, process payments, and maintain account access.

We do not sell personal information — and only share data when required for payment processing, communication (e.g. Mailchimp), or legal compliance.
Users may request access, correction, or deletion of their data anytime by contacting:

6. Intellectual Property

All material, branding, guides, content, templates, and digital assets belong to TouchConnectPro.
Users may not resell, duplicate, copy, or distribute platform materials for commercial or competitive use.

7. No Guarantee of Funding

We help entrepreneurs prepare pitches and may introduce investment opportunities — however:

Investor decisions are independent

Funding is not guaranteed

Outcomes depend on the founder’s execution and readiness

TouchConnectPro is a support system — not a funding provider.

8. Limitation of Liability

Users are responsible for decisions and outcomes arising from mentorship, coaching sessions, and investor interactions.
TouchConnectPro is not liable for:

Business performance or losses

Investment acceptance or rejection

Miscommunication or disputes between users & coaches

Missed sessions or external agreements

Use of the platform is voluntary and at your own discretion.

9. Changes to Terms

Terms & Conditions may be updated as the platform evolves.
The most recent version will always be available here with a revised "Last Updated" date.
