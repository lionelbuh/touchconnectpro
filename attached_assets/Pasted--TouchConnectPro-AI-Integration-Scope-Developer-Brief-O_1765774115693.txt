📄 TouchConnectPro — AI Integration Scope (Developer Brief)
🎯 Objective

All forms and pages already exist.
The only missing piece is to connect AI services at two specific steps:

AI-generated Business Plan draft based on the finalized answers

No UI redesign, no new forms, no new screens are required.

✅ WHAT IS ALREADY DONE (DO NOT CHANGE)
Step 1 — Entrepreneur Information

Basic entrepreneur profile form

❌ No AI involved

User clicks Next

Step 2 — “Tell Us About Your Idea”

43 predefined questions

User answers in free text

Data is already captured

User clicks Next: AI Review

Step 3 — “AI Review” (UI already exists)

Page already designed

Inputs already editable

❌ AI logic NOT connected yet

Step 4 — “Business Plan” (UI already exists)

Final screen
