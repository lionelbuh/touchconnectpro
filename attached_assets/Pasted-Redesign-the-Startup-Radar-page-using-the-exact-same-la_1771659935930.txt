Redesign the “Startup Radar” page using the exact same layout system, color palette, typography, spacing, and human-centered feel as the homepage, pricing page, and FAQ page.

Important:
Do NOT change any of the existing text. Preserve all headings, structure, and wording exactly as written for SEO and AIO performance. Only improve layout and visual presentation.

Goal:
Maintain strong SEO structure while making the page feel premium, warm, and consistent with the rest of the platform. Avoid blog-template or content-farm styling.

Use the same design system:

Background base: Soft cream (#FAF9F7)

Alternating sections: Light gray (#F3F3F3)

Primary headings: Deep teal (#0D566C)

Body text: Dark gray (#4A4A4A)

Accent buttons and links: Coral (#FF6B5C)

Subtle highlights or dividers: Warm yellow (#F5C542)

Soft card shadows (#E0E0E0)

Same typography scale as homepage

Layout instructions:

Hero Section

Keep:

Startup Radar
Operational Guidance for First-Time Founders and Early-Stage Startups

Short intro paragraph below.

Design:

Centered hero layout

Generous spacing

Soft cream background

Clear CTA button “Explore Startup Radar” in Coral

Optional subtle background pattern or soft gradient, not generic

Who This Is For Section

Design as three clean horizontal cards (not rigid 3-column icon blocks).

Use soft shadow cards

Rounded corners

Light gray section background

Clear spacing between cards

Keep text exactly as written

Cards should feel supportive and thoughtful, not sales-driven.

Founder Operations Frameworks Section

Keep the numbered structure (1, 2, 3) but redesign visually.

Large subtle numbers in background (low opacity Deep teal)

Heading in Deep teal

Short description underneath

Add breathing space between each pillar

Avoid tight stacking

This section should feel structured and confident.

Articles Section

Design article previews as premium content cards.

Each article card:

Title in Deep teal

Short description below

Small category tag (Idea stage, First-time founder, Early-stage startup) in Coral badge

Subtle hover effect

Soft shadow

Generous padding

Avoid default blog grid templates.

On desktop:

2-column grid layout
On mobile:

Clean stacked layout

Visual Consistency Requirements

Same button style as homepage

Same hover effects

Same rounded corners

Same spacing rhythm

No generic blog sidebar

No cluttered layout

No overly small text

The page should feel like a structured knowledge hub inside a premium mentorship platform, not a typical blog.

Optional Enhancement:

Add a subtle final section at the bottom:

Headline:
Ready to move from reading to building?

Button:
Start refining your idea

Keep background Deep teal with white text to match other CTA sections.

The final result should feel cohesive with the rest of TouchConnectPro, human-centered, structured, and authoritative without looking corporate or templated.
