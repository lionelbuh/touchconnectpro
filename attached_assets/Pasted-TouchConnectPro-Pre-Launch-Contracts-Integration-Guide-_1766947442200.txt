TouchConnectPro Pre-Launch Contracts – Integration Guide
1️⃣ Add Contracts to Registration Forms

For each role (Coach, Mentor, Investor):

During registration, display the role-specific pre-launch contract (Coach / Mentor / Investor).

Present it in full text inside a scrollable, readable box.

Add a checkbox labeled:

“I have read and agree to the Pre-Launch [Coach/Mentor/Investor] Agreement”

Checkbox is required to submit the registration form.

Optional: Add a “Download PDF” button so users can save a copy.

2️⃣ Capture Acceptance Data

When the user submits the form:

Save the following fields in the database:

user_id

role (Coach / Mentor / Investor)

contract_version (e.g., “2025-12-28 v1”)

timestamp (exact date & time of agreement)

ip_address (for legal record)

user_agent (browser/device info, optional)

contract_text (full text of the agreement at time of signing)

Store in a separate table, e.g., user_contract_acceptances, linked to the user ID.

Example Table Structure:

Column	Type	Description
id	integer	Auto increment
user_id	integer	Reference to Users table
role	string	Coach / Mentor / Investor
contract_version	string	e.g., "Pre-Launch v1"
timestamp	datetime	Exact acceptance time
ip_address	string	Optional for legal verification
contract_text	text	Full agreement at time of acceptance
3️⃣ Store Contract Copies

Database: Save the full text and metadata (see table above).

File storage (optional): Generate a PDF copy of the agreement and save it with a unique filename, e.g.,
contracts/user_{user_id}_{role}_{timestamp}.pdf.

4️⃣ Display in Admin Dashboard

Add a Contracts section in the admin dashboard:

Filter by role (Coach / Mentor / Investor)

Show:

User name / email

Role

Contract version

Timestamp of acceptance

Download/View contract copy (PDF or HTML)

Optional: Include search and sort by date, role, or user.

5️⃣ Display in User Dashboard

Add a “My Agreements” section for each user:

List all agreements the user has signed

Show:

Contract version

Role

Timestamp of acceptance

Include a “Download PDF” or “View Contract” button

6️⃣ Version Control

Each contract version should have a unique version ID.

When updating contracts:

Display the new version on next login/registration for new users

Keep old versions stored for audit/legal purposes

7️⃣ Security & Compliance

Ensure all contract text and timestamps are immutable (or append-only).

Keep audit logs of changes in case of disputes.

Use SSL encryption for all transmissions of contracts.

8️⃣ Optional Enhancements

Auto-generate PDF contracts with user info (name, email, date/time) embedded.

Send confirmation email to user with a copy of the signed contract.

Add reminders in admin dashboard for users who haven’t accepted the latest version (future updates).

✅ Summary

Show role-specific contract at registration → checkbox consent → capture timestamp, IP, and full contract → store in DB and optionally as PDF → display in both user and admin dashboards → keep versions for audit.
